# cse-project-1

### My Updates :
- implemented credit based cgpa system
- redesigned (formal unix like command line interface)
- included `<string.h>`
- `clear()` function (editability)
- removed `student.grad` & `student.total`
- renamed stored data to `.dat` extension
- Fixed Error messages

### Still to do :
- Edit Data (Edit data of same id)
- Do not repeate same Id (If same Id exists already, show error)

### Tested in msys2 env with gcc (Rev7, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.1.0 compiler
### Commands :
- Compile & run : `make`
- clean : `make clean`
Run locally in vs code : `ctrl` + `shift` + `b`
